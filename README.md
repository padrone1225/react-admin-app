# ReactJS Admin Template

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/trajano/reactjs-admin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/trajano/reactjs-admin)

This provides a port of a bootstrap admin template to use the ReactJS framework running under webpack.

This does not provide any backend connectivity and is primarily using ReactJS as a view layer.

# Installation

`npm install`

This will run `webpack -p` to build the resulting site in the `dist` folder.

# Development mode

`npm start`

This will start up a server on http://localhost:8080/ that will show the portfolio site.  It is configured to automatically refresh the page when there is a change in the application.
